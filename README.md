# EfronSpeech
A JavaScript based Assistant that opens a windows to different websites when you use your voice and that has a modern looking clock.

Here's are the command that it can do for you when you say them:  

"Efron open YouTube"  

"Efron open GitHub"  

"Efron open Spotify"  

"Efron play Kevin's favourite song"  

"Efron open Instagram"  

"Efron open Reddit"  

"Efron open Netflix"  

"Efron open code academy"  

"Efron open freecodecamp"  

"Efron open Gmail"  

"Efron open Amazon"  

"Efron open Duolingo"  

IMPORTANT: If you say something that isn't one of the commands or is said incorrectly then the Assistant will say "Sorry, I cannot do that".
